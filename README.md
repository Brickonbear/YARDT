# YARDT
This is a deck tracker for Legends Of Runeterra. Made primarily so that you don't have to use the Mobalytics one since it uses Overwolf.

## Setup

To use the deck tracker, you will need to do a first time launch. The deck tracker will download and then crop all of the necessary images, after which you will be free to use it. 

## Future plans

Currently the deck tracker is functioning as intended, but lacks a couple of features:

 - [x] Port change option
 - [x] Automatic updates
 - [x] Expedition support
 - [ ] Support for different languages

## Known issues

The way the program is set up now is not 100% efficient, but that is due to Riot's API not functioning properly on Expeditions; The static decklist of the api often returns errors when used during expeditions, so a workaround had to be implemented. It will be changed once Riot's API no longer produces the errors mentioned.
