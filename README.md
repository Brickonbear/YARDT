# YARDT
This is a WIP deck tracker for Legends Of Runeterra. Made primarily so that you don't have to use the mobalytics one since it uses overwolf.

## Setup

To use the deck tracker, you will need to do a first time launch. The deck tracker will download and then crop all of the necessary images, after which you will be free to use it. 

## Future plans

Currently the deck tracker is functioning as intended, but lacks some features, such as a field to choose your own port or Expeditions support. These features are planned to be implemented at a later time, but no specific date can be given at this moment.
