This is a deck tracker for Legends Of Runeterra. Made primarily so that you don't have to use the Mobalytics one since it uses Overwolf.

## Setup

To use the deck tracker, you will need to do a first time launch. The deck tracker will download and then crop all of the necessary images, after which you will be free to use it. 

## Important info

If the deck tracker doesn't work or manages to fail after one or two games, please try changing the port on both the deck tracker and the game to something like 21338 (also make sure to enable third party support after doing so!). If that still doesn't work, then I am sorry but you are out of luck; 99% of the time it isn't the program failing, but Riot's API. We are aware of this, but it is simply not possible for us to do anything about it. If an issue arises that is different from just not tracking, feel free to inform us about it, but note that it is not in our power to fix anything on the API end. 

## Future plans

Currently the program is functioning as intended, but do note that because of other priorities we can not focus on it too much, hence the features described below are considered, but will most likely not be implemented soon, earliest time would be the summer period. (we will still fix breaking issues, such as a new expansions coming out)

List of features suggested:

Features considered:
 - [x] Port change option
 - [x] Automatic updates
 - [x] Expedition support
 - [x] Card stats (cards left in deck/hand, draw chances)
 - [x] Support for different languages
 - [ ] Enemy cards played
 - [ ] Card graveyard
 - [x] Darken colour of cards that can no longer be drawn (0 of that card left in deck)
 - [ ] Add shuffled cards to deck tracker
 - [x] Auto minimize deck tracker when not in game
Features rejected:
 - [ ] Enemy cards in hand (Currently not possible due to API limitations)
 - [ ] Deck winrate stats (Not planned to be implemented, unless made as a seperate application)
